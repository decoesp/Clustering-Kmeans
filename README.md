# Clustering-Kmeans
 Simple Artificial Intelligence using clustering and K-means with tensorflow.

# Clustering-Kmeans


Using the tensorflow the code is grouping with the k-means algorithm.

# WHAT IS CLUSTER AND K-MEANS:

* Clustering is a data mining exercise where we take a lot of data and find groups of points that are similar to each other.
* K-means is an algorithm that is great for finding clusters on many types of datasets.

The algorithm in question generates its own data however you can implement a data set that it will recognize.


### Here's an article explaining the experiment:
